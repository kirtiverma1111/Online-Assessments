Online Assessments for Employee Training Best Practices
Today, the corporate world is rapidly racing with innovative alternatives for accomplishing employee training and development. Online assessments are at the forefront of any common training program in the modern world and offer a good insight into how employees perform, retain knowledge, and develop skills. These assessments are well integrated into organizations with the help of Think Exam. But how are businesses supposed to maximise the respective use of online assessments? The best practices for embracing online assessments into employee training programs are here.

The Importance of Online Assessments for Employee Training

Identify knowledge gaps.
Measure the efficacy of any training regimen.
Customised learning experiences.
Compliance to standards in the industry.
Having listed the benefits, the next thing to do will be to strategise into getting the most out of online assessments, which is really important.
Best Practices for Online Assessments
Clear Goals
Know the objectives or goal of the assessment before you prepare for it. What will you be assessing – is it technical skills, soft skills, or knowledge on some regulations? 

Defining clear goals will give a direction on the construction type and scope of the assessment. 

Pro Tip: Use SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals to ensure your objectives are actionable.

Align Assessments with Training Modules
Integrate assessments into training materials for the best results, and after every training module, for example, include the relevant quiz or practical exam after the training module to reinforce what has been learned and keep track of how much was understood.

Example: If the training is about cybersecurity, it should feature scenario-based questions that would determine how employees would respond to some potential cyber threats.

Leverage the Technology
Modern tools such as Think Exam have other engaging and interesting features. A wide variety of question types include:

Multiple choice.
Drag and drop.
Case studies.
Video based questions with role play scenarios.
Interactive assessments would always keep students lively and increase retention.
Accessibility Flexibility
For some employees, handling everything becomes very challenging; flexibility in the hours allows employees to avail themselves for assessments anytime and anywhere. It must be accessible in terms of mobile devices and desktops to make learning easy around different environments.

Timely Feedback
Timely feedback helps employees identify their strengths and weaknesses as well. Instant feedback from digitally scored marks and the complete scorecards should also accompany proper and actionable recommendations for further learning.

Real-World Applications
Assessment design is similar to that in the real world. This enables the employee to apply what he/she learns directly into his/her job and thus strengthens practical skills and boosts confidence.

For example, sales training should include a role-play exercise where the employee responds to an objection from the customer.

Safeguard Data In the Cloud
Sensitive employee information is often involved in the online assessment. The likes of Think Exam have strong security features that keep it up to date with today’s privacy standards. Regular updates of software and access control will help protect data.

Completion Rates.
Average Scores.
Time Spent per Question.
Let these details make your training programs better and indicate the trends of learning progress.

Build a Learning Organisation
Encourage employees to take assessments as stairways to growth rather than judgment. Recognize progress and motivate them for continuous enhancement.

Prototype and Iterate
Test assessment applications with a small group before deploying them across the whole company. Obtain feedback and make necessary changes to ensure the content aligns with your corporate goals, format, and technology.
